## Weather Data Analysis
This project is an analysis of weather data collected in 2012. Using Python and Pandas, I explored temperature trends, weather conditions, and performed data cleaning, outlier detection, and visualizations.

**Key Features:**
- Data cleaning and handling missing values
- Outlier detection using IQR method
- Visualizations of temperature trends over time
- Grouped analysis by weather condition and month
